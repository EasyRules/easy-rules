@Value:
-------
read only but will generate a public AllArgsConstructor which you use to instantiate instances.
equivalent to:
final @ToString @EqualsAndHashCode @AllArgsConstructor @FieldDefaults(makeFinal = true, level = AccessLevel.PRIVATE) @Getter

@Builder:
---------
once built, the resulting instance is immutable. Often combined with @Getter to be able to read the values.
Auto generates a private constructor so no need to include @xxxConstructor annotations.

above statement NOT entirely correct. It is still possible to modify the object using reflection for example.
to be fully immutable, the fields should be made final.
@Accessor:
----------
allows you to specify a chain option for fluency. Often combined with @Getter and @Setter.
The instantiated object is mutable.
